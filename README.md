Cant get the dependencies to install.. Removed expo, reinstalled expo, deleted all the projects, cloned it from the original still the same. I keep getting an error message:

expo.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
